So if you are a developer/coding enthusiast living in India, you may have heard about this:<br>

<br><br>
Well, guess what? I applied for it. There were steps, like trials of sorts. First one has to take an online assessment to see if they have the pre-requisite knowledge, then there was a face-to-face video conference interview with some Googlers, and then after a couple weeks of waiting I recieved a mail telling me that I'd qualified.<br><br>
Yup, that's right! I got selected among THOUSANDS of other applicants! How awesome is that?
<br><br>
So here's the deal: this means I have a LOT more workload now... though the program is self-paced, it still has guidelines to pace ourselves and assumes 10 hours of work every week. Combined with college work and all, that's pretty daunting. But hey, I can work with that, right? 
<br>(Sure hope so...)
<br>That's about it for now...I'll leave some links down below for you to check out if interested.
