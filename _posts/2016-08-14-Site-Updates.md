It's been a long time since I've last had time to update the site or post something new, but over the last couple days I have got some work done.
<br> Firstly, updated the visuals around the site. More Material design everywhere! What do you guys think? Leave some feedback by pressing that ever present FAB down below.
<br> I also added a new ['Projects'](/projects "Projects") page to the site, for me to show off all the awesome stuff I've worked on :D
<br>Be sure to check it out!
