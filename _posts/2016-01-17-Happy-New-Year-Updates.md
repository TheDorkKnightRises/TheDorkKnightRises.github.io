Happy New Year to everybody! Hope you are enjoying 2016 and continue to do so throughout the year.
<br>Now that we got the pleasantries out of the way, let me tell you about the newest addition to the site: a feedback FAB (Floating Action Button) that has been masterfully positioned with animated auto-hide transitions using CSS and jQuery.
<br>So go ahead, press it, and speak your mind!

Sayonara!
