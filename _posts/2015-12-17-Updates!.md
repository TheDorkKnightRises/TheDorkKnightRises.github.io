Finally got around to updating the site a bit (even though I'm literally in the middle of my semester exams :P)
<br>Mostly visual updates, Material Design elements through integration of Google's MDL (Material Design Lite) framework.
<br>The blog section in particular has been revamped (one of the reasons for this post is to check multiple posts are displayed correctly actually).

That's about it for now. I should go study...
